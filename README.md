# Student Portfolio Website
SAHIL 

This repository contains a multi‑page personal student portfolio website created using only HTML and basic CSS.
The project demonstrates correct usage of semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, float for layout, flexbox for alignment, and HTML forms.
It consists of four separate pages: index.html as the Home Page, about.html as the About Me Page, skills.html as the Skills and Projects Page, and contact.html as the Contact Form Page. 
A common navigation bar appears on all pages, including the student name or logo and links to Home, About, Skills, and Contact.
The About page introduces the student with a short personal description and a profile image, styled using float.
The Skills page presents at least three skill or project cards, each with a title, short description, background color, and border, aligned using flexbox.
The Contact page provides a styled form with fields for name, email, subject, message, and a submit button.
